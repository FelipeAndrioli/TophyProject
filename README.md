## The idea behind it

This is the initial idea behind the Tophy Project. The came from the necessity of an engine
to create a different kind of desktop software, and thinking and working on the idea I got 
another idea, to have this engine to the different kind of software and for games, so the 
engine will have two fronts.

## Desktop Software Front

The software development front will have a different kind of approach, I can't explain it yet,
it's only an idea on my mind, I need to work a little bit more on it and create some kind of
image to explain it better.

## Game Development Front

The game development front will have some requirements, like be able to create realistic graphics
and physics on your own time, but first our approach will be more likeable Zelda Breath of the Wild,
a cartoon based graphics and a considerable physics.

## Objectives

I never think to envolve myself in the game development environment, but this idea stayed on my
head for too long. Due to this I'll have the most basic objectives, to begin from the basics of 
the engine. Then I'll begin with:

	- Learn how engines work.
	- Learn the initial steps to begin.

## Final project

The Tophy Engine will need to be available to almost all programming languages (less for the
web developing ones). It need to allow the user create objects inside the engine, mobile games,
console games, and the main goal is to allow users create pc games. The software front need to be
studied a little bit more yet.

	- Creating objects inside the engine
	- Mobile games
	- Console games
	- Pc games
	- Desktop software
